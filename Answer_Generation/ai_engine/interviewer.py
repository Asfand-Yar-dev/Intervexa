Interviewer Agent Module for Smart Mock Interview System
==========================================================

This module uses Google's Gemini API to generate technical interview questions
and provide feedback on candidate answers.

Usage (Backend Integration):
    from ai_engine.interviewer import InterviewConductor

    conductor = InterviewConductor(api_key="your_key")
    questions = conductor.generate_questions(
        job_role="Python Developer",
        tech_stack="Python, Django",
        difficulty="Medium"
    )
    feedback = conductor.generate_feedback(question, user_answer)

Dependencies:
    pip install google-generativeai

   - Scenario-based where appropriate
   - Relevant to the specific tech stack mentioned
   - Progressive in difficulty
   - Distinct from each other (no overlapping topics)

3. Question types to include:
   - Core concepts and fundamentals
   - Real-world problem-solving scenarios
   - Best practices and design patterns
   - Performance and optimization
   - Architecture and system design (for senior roles)

4. OUTPUT FORMAT:
